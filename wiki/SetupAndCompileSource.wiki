#summary Setup and compile source.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Compile source =

== Requirements ==
You need a working Android SDK and NDK setup.

== Setup source ==
Change directory to $(ANDROID_NDK)/apps and checkout the code from svn.
Enter nethackdroid/project/jni and run the bootstrap.sh script to download, setup and build NetHack source tools that produces a nhdat file which is the nethack data file.

== Compile source ==
The sources is devided in two parts one JNI C interface and the actual android application.

=== Compile NDK part ===
First you need to build the JNI interface and it's native library libnethackjni.so.
Doing that by change directory to Android NDK top-level directory and run command:
{{{
APP="nethackdroid" make -f GNUMakefile
}}}
this does build 2 libraries, libnethack (static library) and libnethackjni.so.

=== Build Android application  ===
Change directory to apps/nethackdroid/project, if it's the first time you compile the application you need to issue the command:
{{{
android update project -p .
}}}
to update the source for your suite...

Then you can build the application...
